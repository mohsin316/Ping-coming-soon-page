## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

For future plans for now its to do more and more javascript. I want to use my new skills and make amazing projects. Super glad font-end-mentor exists. After playing around with Js I might study a framework or start a little bit on the backend. In fact I was considering looking up a few videos on using Figma and learn how to design proper websites.
